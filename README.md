##  Business Background

In the highly competitive retail and e-commerce industry, understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing strategies is key to staying competitive.  
The marketing team was struggling with **generic campaigns, poor engagement, and low loyalty**.  
This project aims to apply **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** segmentation to **categorize customers and enable more tailored, effective marketing strategies**.
