## 🔹 Tools Used
- **Python:** pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI, Tableau
- **Other:** MySQL, Google Colab
- **Techniques:** RFM scoring, segmentation, visualization, customer behavior analysis

## 🔹 Timeline
The project was completed in **about 2-3 months**, from data understanding and preparation to final delivery.

- Analyzed segments’ characteristics.
- Derived actionable strategies for each group.

4️⃣ **Visualization:**  
- Built a Power BI and Tableau Dashboard to visualize segments and key metrics.

 **Champion:**  
- Most valuable, frequently purchasing, and highest spending.

 **Loyal:**  
- Frequent buyer with strong loyalty but not highest spending.

 **At Risk:**  
- May churn; large transactions previously but now inactive.

 **Hibernating:**
